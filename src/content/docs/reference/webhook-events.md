Every successful operation emits one of the events below. Webhooks, the audit
log and compliance export are all built on them. An event carries ids, who did
it and when — never page content, and never a secret.

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `page.created` | A page was created. |
| `page.updated` | A page was edited and the change published. |
| `page.deleted` | A page was permanently deleted (purged from the trash, or swept by retention). |
| `page.trashed` | A page (and its subtree) was moved to the trash. |
| `page.trash_restored` | A page (and its subtree) was restored from the trash. |
| `page.restored` | A page was restored from a prior revision. |
| `page.published` | A page revision was published. |
| `page.access_granted` | Someone was given access to a page. |
| `page.access_revoked` | Someone's access to a page was taken away. |
| `page.access_restricted` | Someone was blocked from a page, overriding any access they would otherwise inherit. |
| `page.access_unrestricted` | A block on someone's access to a page was lifted. |
| `page.made_private` | A page was made private: only the people named on it can open it, it stops inheriting access from its space, and any public link stops working. |
| `page.made_non_private` | A page stopped being private and inherits access from its space again. |
| `page.made_public` | A published page was opened to anyone with the link, no sign-in needed. Search engines are asked not to index it. |
| `page.made_non_public` | A page stopped being open to anyone; the link no longer works without signing in. |
| `page.frozen` | A page was frozen against edits — either for everyone who cannot manage it, or for share-link guests only. |
| `page.unfrozen` | A page was unfrozen and can be edited again. |
| `space.created` | A space was created. |
| `space.updated` | A space was updated. |
| `vendor.access` | An operator used emergency access on this workspace (recorded for Access Transparency). |
| `space.deleted` | A space was deleted. |
| `space.access_granted` | Someone was given access to a space. |
| `space.access_revoked` | Someone's access to a space was taken away. |
| `space.branding_updated` | A space's accent colour was changed. |
| `space.made_public` | A space was opened to anyone with the link, no sign-in needed. Search engines are asked not to index it. |
| `space.made_non_public` | A space stopped being open to anyone; the link no longer works without signing in. |
| `tenant.branding_updated` | The workspace's accent colour and logo were changed. |
| `tenant.embed_providers_updated` | An admin changed which outside sites may be embedded in pages. |
| `tenant.oidc_updated` | The workspace's own OIDC sign-in settings were changed. |
| `tenant.login_methods_updated` | An admin changed which sign-in methods the workspace offers. |
| `tenant.oidc_recovered` | An operator turned OIDC off for a workspace that had locked itself out. |
| `tenant.login_methods_recovered` | An operator set a locked-out workspace's sign-in methods from outside the product, turning one back on if that is what it took. |
| `tenant.saml_recovered` | An operator turned SAML off for a workspace that had locked itself out. |
| `tenant.custom_domain_added` | A custom domain was added (pending verification). |
| `tenant.custom_domain_verified` | A custom domain was verified and activated. |
| `tenant.custom_domain_removed` | A custom domain was removed and stopped serving the workspace. |
| `tenant.custom_domain_unverified` | A verified custom domain stopped proving ownership and went back to pending; links use the workspace's original address until it is verified again. |
| `tenant.saml_updated` | The workspace's SAML single sign-on settings were changed (EE). |
| `tenant.plan_changed` | The workspace's plan changed. |
| `tenant.ai_toggled` | An admin turned AI features on or off for the workspace. |
| `usage.threshold_crossed` | Usage crossed an alert threshold, ahead of the limit that would start turning requests away. EE and Cloud notify the admin. |
| `orphan_draft.enumerated` | An admin listed the private drafts whose author is gone. |
| `orphan_draft.claimed` | An admin took temporary access to an orphaned draft; the claim is recorded. |
| `orphan_draft.reassigned` | An orphaned draft was handed to an active member. |
| `orphan_draft.claim_expired` | A claim on an orphaned draft expired before the draft was handed to anyone. |
| `scim_token.created` | A SCIM provisioning token was issued (EE). |
| `scim_token.revoked` | A SCIM provisioning token was revoked (EE). |
| `attachment.confirmed` | An uploaded attachment was confirmed (counts toward storage). |
| `attachment.deleted` | An attachment was deleted. |
| `share_link.revoked` | An anonymous share link was revoked. |
| `api_key.created` | An API key was issued. |
| `api_key.revoked` | An API key was revoked. The webhook payload includes the key owner: ownerId (member sub) and ownerName (display name, never an email; null if unknown). |
| `auth.success` | Someone signed in successfully. |
| `auth.failed` | A sign-in attempt failed. |
| `member.added` | A member was added to the workspace. |
| `member.role_changed` | A member's role was changed. |
| `member.removed` | A member was removed from the workspace. |
| `member.locked` | Password sign-in was locked for an identifier after repeated failures (it expires on its own). |
| `member.password_changed` | A member changed their own password (their other sessions were signed out). |
| `member.suspended` | An admin suspended a member: sign-in blocked, access taken away, API keys revoked, sessions ended. The membership and its seat stay. |
| `member.reactivated` | An admin brought a suspended member back. Roles that came from a group are not restored — the identity directory adds those again. |
| `member.password_enabled` | An admin gave an existing member a password to sign in with (the account had none before). |
| `member.factor_enrolled` | A member added a second factor — an authenticator app — to their own account. |
| `member.factor_removed` | A member removed a second factor from their own account, proving possession of it first. |
| `member.factors_reset` | A member's second factors were cleared so they could enrol again after losing the device; their sessions were ended with it. `reason` says who did it: an admin, or the member themselves with a recovery code. |
| `member.recovery_codes_minted` | A member generated a set of recovery codes for their own account. How many is recorded; the codes themselves are shown once and are never sent anywhere else. |
| `member.recovery_codes_revoked` | A set of recovery codes stopped being usable — replaced by a fresh set (`re-mint`), spent to recover the account (`used`), or cleared with the factors by an admin (`admin_reset`). |
| `tenant.second_factor_policy_changed` | A workspace changed which second factors it requires: off, any, passkeys only, or authenticator apps only. |
| `member.password_removed` | An admin removed a member's password sign-in; their sessions were ended with it. |
| `member.password_reset_requested` | A password reset link was requested for a member. |
| `member.password_reset_completed` | A member completed a password reset (all their sessions were signed out). |
| `invite.created` | A member invite was created. |
| `invite.revoked` | A member invite was revoked. |
| `invite.reissued` | A pending invite was given a fresh link; the previous one stopped working. |
| `comment.created` | A comment was created on a page. |
