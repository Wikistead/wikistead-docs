Every successful operation emits one of the events below. Webhooks, the audit
log and compliance export are all built on them. An event carries ids, who did
it and when — never page content, and never a secret.

A few events stay inside your workspace and are never sent to a webhook. Sign-in
attempts are one per request, so delivering them would be a firehose rather than a
signal; recovery actions by our staff are reported to you without naming the person
who performed them. The last column says what each event sends.

The last column is about the KIND of event. Separately, an event about one page is
checked against that page when it is about to be sent: nothing is sent about a private
page or about a draft that has never been published, because the id alone would say
the page exists. So an event marked as sent can still be withheld for one page.

| Event | Description | Sent to webhooks |
|---|---|---|
| `page.created` | A page was created. | Yes |
| `page.renamed` | A page was given a new title. | Yes |
| `page.moved` | A page was moved to a different parent or space. | Yes |
| `page.deleted` | A page was permanently deleted (purged from the trash, or swept by retention). | Yes |
| `page.trashed` | A page (and its subtree) was moved to the trash. | Yes |
| `page.trash_restored` | A page (and its subtree) was restored from the trash. | Yes |

| `page.access_granted` | Someone was given access to a page. | Yes |
| `page.access_revoked` | Someone's access to a page was taken away. | Yes |

| `page.access_unrestricted` | A block on someone's access to a page was lifted. | Yes |
| `page.made_private` | A page was made private: only the people named on it can open it, it stops inheriting access from its space, and any public link stops working. | Yes |
| `page.made_non_private` | A page stopped being private and inherits access from its space again. | Yes |
| `page.made_public` | A published page was opened to anyone with the link, no sign-in needed. Search engines are asked not to index it. | Yes |
| `page.made_non_public` | A page stopped being open to anyone; the link no longer works without signing in. | Yes |

| `tenant.oidc_recovered` | An operator turned OIDC off for a workspace that had locked itself out. | No |

| `tenant.custom_domain_removed` | A custom domain was removed and stopped serving the workspace. | Yes |

| `member.suspended` | An admin suspended a member: sign-in blocked, access taken away, API keys revoked, sessions ended. The membership and its seat stay. | Yes |
| `member.reactivated` | An admin brought a suspended member back. Roles that came from a group are not restored — the identity directory adds those again. | Yes |
| `member.password_enabled` | An admin gave an existing member a password to sign in with (the account had none before). | Yes |

| `invite.created` | A member invite was created. | Yes |
| `invite.revoked` | A member invite was revoked. | Yes |
