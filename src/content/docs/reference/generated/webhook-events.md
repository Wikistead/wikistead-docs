  This is the "code is truth" domain-event reference (the EE webhook / audit surface).
-->



The CE event bus emits a `DomainEvent` after each successful operation. EE features
(webhooks, audit log, compliance export) subscribe to these. Events carry only ids,
actors, and timestamps — never page content or secrets. Generated from the code
(`EVENT_CATALOG`).
